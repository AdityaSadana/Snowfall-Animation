Animation Javascript library.
Include this in your website by adding the script tag 

    <script src="snowfall.js"></script>
    
The division in which you want the animation set it's id=intro.
You can also customize and change the number of snow elements or the animation time with the help of instructions given in the js file as comments.
You also need to have a jquery cdn added as a script to your html file.
